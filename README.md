## How it works

This project is divided into two parts:
1. Backend (You can find here: https://github.com/okitauehara/gratibox-api)
2. Frontend (This repository)

---

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Running the Frontend


``` jsx

// Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:okitauehara/atelie-front.git

// Access the project folder cmd/terminal
$ cd atelie-front

// Install the dependencies
$ npm install

// If you want to run your app on localhost, create a .env file with the environment variable pointing to your local server.

// Run the application in development mode
$ npm start

// The server will start at port: 3000

```

You can find an .env.example <a href="https://github.com/okitauehara/atelie-front/blob/main/.env.example">here</a>.
